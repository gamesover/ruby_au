  bio: |
    Mark is a former-sysadmin-turned-developer with a lifelong interest in tech,
    science and maths. He started his Ruby journey in 2008 with Rails. These
    days, he uses Ruby and a handful of other languages - but Ruby is his staple
    language, because of both the language itself and the community around it.
    He is also keen to help the tech industry be a better and more inclusive
    place, particularly for people with disabilities.

    Outside of tech, he watches more TV than is probably healthy, manages to be
    a halfway-decent home cook, and is keen to do more travelling.

    Also [Perth Ruby Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/roro-perth/members/?op=leaders) co-organiser.
